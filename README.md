# Frameworks-plus
This repository contains a compilation of MT Frameworks and campaigns built on them.  Creators of new projects are welcome to request space to commit directly to the tools database or to provide links to their current GitHub or GitLab projects for inclusion in the collection.

The MapTool community has created an amazing body of work and this project is dedicated to assisting users in accessing that content and providing guidance and support to create more content for all to use.

If you are interested in contributing to development of an existing framework project, please coordinate directly with the framework developer.  If you are interested in developing a new framework or creating new content for existing frameworks, please contact the repository owner or inquire in the MapTool Discord server @ https://discord.gg/SBd6KxWHcU

Please contact rpgnexusproject@gmail.com if you have any questions or wish to assist with the MT-Tools-Database collection or any other RPGNexus projects.
